Hello!  

I'm a Field Robotics Leader at [ANYbotics](https://www.anybotics.com/), driving the growth and performance of a global Customer Success field team that delivers autonomous inspection robots to industrial customers worldwide. I design team structures, shape processes, and lead deployments that turn cutting-edge robotics into measurable customer value in some of the toughest environments on the planet.  

I hold an MBA and a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Before joining ANYbotics, I worked as a Field Application Engineer at [Sensirion](https://www.sensirion.com/), a leading provider of environmental sensor technology, where I guided mainly Asian clients in integrating advanced sensing solutions into their products. During my studies, I completed both my Master’s and Semester Thesis at [Disney Research Zurich](https://www.disneyresearch.com/), the latter in collaboration with renowned artists [Pors & Rao](https://www.porsandrao.com/).  

Outside of robotics, I tinker with side projects you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lumics) — from an [Espresso Shot Timer](https://github.com/Lumics/EspressiShotTimer) :coffee: to a [plant watering system](https://github.com/Lumics/Plantwatery) :seedling:, or pulling sensor data from my apartment :bar_chart: to optimize climate control and automation. When I’m not in “build mode”, you’ll find me running :runner:, traveling :earth_africa:, experimenting in the kitchen ([eatup.ch](https://eatup.ch)) :fried_egg:, or behind my camera :camera: ([maurinwidmer.ch](https://maurinwidmer.ch)).
